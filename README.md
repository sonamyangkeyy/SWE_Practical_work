Lowercase Conversion: This ensures that "Word" and "word" are considered the same.
Splitting: The split() method breaks the text into words.
Set for Uniqueness: A set automatically handles duplicates.
Count: The length of the set gives the number of unique words.

-find_longest_word Function:
It splits the text into words.
It uses max() with key=len to find the longest word.
The program counts unique words and finds the longest word in the provided text.

count_word_occurrences Function:
Converts both the input text and the target word to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison.
Splits the text into words and uses the count() method to count how many times the target word appears.

calculate_average_word_length Function:
Calculates the average length of words by summing their lengths and dividing by the total number of words.
percentage_of_long_words Function:
Uses the average word length to determine which words are longer than that average.
Calculates the percentage of these long words compared to the total number of words.

- fibonacci_up_to(n):
This function generates a list of Fibonacci numbers up to a specified limit n.

- index_of_first_fib_exceeding(value):
This function returns the index of the first Fibonacci number that exceeds a given value.

- is_fibonacci_number(x):
This function checks if a given number x is a Fibonacci number by generating Fibonacci numbers until it either finds x or exceeds it.

- fibonacci_ratios(n):
This function calculates the ratios of consecutive Fibonacci numbers and returns them in a list, showing how they approach the golden ratio.

we can specify the value of n to get Fibonacci numbers.
